~~In the event that access to TWU campuses is completely disrupted,~~ Now that the University has decided to move online for the remainder of this semester, here are several strategies that you may employ as faculty or staff to mitigate the impact on learners in your courses. However, before considering technological 'solutions' to the problem of limited or no access to campus, it is critical to recognize that ~~if~~ now that we find ourselves in that situation, there are a host of very human and messy pressures on learners in your classes, faculty and staff in your department, and administrators at all levels. These pressures and the associated stresses in all of our lives will never be resolved by 'going online'. Ever.

Above all else, remember that we are all human. Your courses are already disrupted and you will not be able to maintain the *status quo*. Your learners will not be able to maintain the *status quo*. Deans, AVPs, VPs, EDs and everyone who supports the work of learning at TWU will not be able to maintain the *status quo*. And that is ok.

### Cognitive Load
It is important to note that all members of the TWU community are under higher than normal levels of stress, and we know that high levels of stress lead directly to lowered ability of people to handle cognitive load. In short, stress makes it difficult to think and process information. This has significant impact on learners ability to engage at a level that might otherwise be expected.

Please remember to be flexible and gracious with everyone.

### What can you do to get ready for this disruption?

##### Learner Readiness

It is worth thinking about how prepared your learners are for moving online. We have created a brief 2-minute survey that we would be happy to share with you so that you can get some basic data on what to expect from your students. If you would like to deploy this survey with your students, please email [colin.madland@twu.ca](mailto:colin.madland@twu.ca).


<https://www.surveymonkey.ca/r/73HZ3GS>

##### Checking Access

You may want to create a way for learners in your course to let you know that they are able to access your Moodle site. Here are some suggestions:

- [Get yourself logged in](https://create.twu.ca/help/moodle/basics/introduction)
- Check the 'Participants' list linked in the menu on the left side of the course page.
  - the second-to-last column on the right is a record of their last login.
- [set up a forum](https://create.twu.ca/help/moodle/faculty/activity-or-resource/creating-a-forum) and request that learners respond to a question like:
  - where are your feet right now?
  - what birds can you hear from where you are?
  - what is the biggest question you have about the remainder of the course?
- [send a message](https://create.twu.ca/help/moodle/faculty/participants/sending-mass-messages) with the same info as above
- [check the course logs](https://create.twu.ca/help/moodle/faculty/participants/view-course-logs)
  - you will be able to see much greater detail about who has signed in to Moodle and what they have looked at.

##### Communication Preferences
- ***teaching Online does NOT mean you have to answer all learner questions as soon as they come in!!***
  - make it clear that you will answer questions within XX hours (no more than 24 IMO) but not between 10:00 pm and 8:00 am.
- publicize your communication preferences and ask learners to share theirs (and then make an effort to accommodate)
- email is a robust and effective communication method, but have students check their default email addresses in Moodle
- set up an FAQ forum in your course so that learners can ask questions and you can answer *once*.
